# riscv-emulator

RISCV emulator written in plain C as individual project of 9th semester's subject on RISCV ISA. Initial idea is to implement emulator for basic RV64I ISA extension, and work my way up to more complex extensions. 

Goal:
	Input binary file already compiled for RV64I arch, and simulate work of a CPU based on an input application binary. Binary file will be generated by already existing RISCV compiler. Second stage of a project would include building a simple C to RISCV compiler on my own.

Future plans: create a RISCV RV64* (insert an extension) toolchain involving emulator, compiler, assembler and debugger. What about a small OS?

Project started on a rainy and slightly chaotic November 10th 2023
