# riscv-toolchain

RISCV emulator written in C++ as individual project of 9th semester's subject on RISCV ISA. Initial idea is to implement emulator for basic RV64I ISA extension, and work my way up to more complex extensions.

Goal:
	Input binary file already compiled for RV64I arch, and simulate work of a CPU based on an input application binary. Binary file will be generated by already existing RISCV compiler. Second stage of a project would include building a simple C to RISCV compiler on my own.
